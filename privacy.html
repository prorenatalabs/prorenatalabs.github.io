            <strong>Internal Uses</strong>
            <p> We may use your personal information within Prorenata Labs: (1) to provide you with the services and products
              you request or that have been ordered and/or requested by your healthcare provider acting on your behalf; (2)
              to answer questions about our services; billing, payment methods or use of our website; (3) to process or collect

            <strong>Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties</strong>

              provide such information for the limited purpose of providing services to us and who are obligated to keep
              the information confidential), unless (1) you have authorized us to do so; (2) we are legally required to do

            <h4>How We Protect Information Online</h4>
            <p>We exercise great care to protect your personal information. This includes, among other things, using industry
              standard techniques such as firewalls, encryption, and intrusion detection. As a result, while we strive to
              protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit
              to us or receive from us. This is especially true for information you transmit to us via email since we have
              no way of protecting that information until it reaches us since email does not have the security features that
              are built into our websites.</p>
            <p>In addition, we limit Prorenata Labs' employees and contractors' access to personal information. Only those

              about the importance of maintaining confidentiality of customer information.</p>

            <h4>How We May Use or Disclose Your Health Information</h4>
            <p>We use your PHI for treatment, payment, or healthcare operations purposes and for other purposes permitted
              or required by law. Not every use or disclosure is listed in this Notice, but all of our uses or disclosures
              of your health information will fall into one of the categories listed below.</p>
            <p>We need your written authorization to use or disclose your health information for any purpose not covered
              by one of the categories below. Subject to compliance with limited exceptions, we will not use or disclose
              psychotherapy notes, use or disclose your PHI for marketing purposes or sell your PHI, unless you have signed
              an authorization. You may revoke any authorization you sign at any time. If you revoke your authorization,
              we will no longer use or disclose your health information for the reasons stated in your authorization except
              to the extent we have already taken action based on your authorization.</p>
            <p>The law permits us to use and disclose your health information for the following purposes:</p>
            <strong>Treatment</strong>
            <p>Prorenata Labs provides laboratory testing for physicians and other healthcare professionals, and we use your
              information in our testing process. We disclose your health information to authorized healthcare professionals
              who order tests or need access to your test results for treatment purposes. Examples of other treatment related
              purposes include disclosure to a pathologist to help interpret your test results or use of your information
              to contact you to obtain another specimen, if necessary.</p>
            <strong>Payment</strong>
            <p>Prorenata Labs will use and disclose your PHI for purposes of billing and payment. For example, we may disclose
              your PHI to health plans or other payers to determine whether you are enrolled with the payer or eligible for
              health benefits or to obtain payment for our services. If you are insured under another person’s health insurance
              policy (for example, parent, spouse, domestic partner or a former spouse), we may also send invoices to the
              subscriber whose policy covers your health services.</p>
            <strong>Healthcare Operations</strong>
            <p>Prorenata Labs may use and disclose your PHI for activities necessary to support our healthcare operations,
              such as performing quality checks on our testing, internal audits, arranging for legal services or developing
              reference ranges for our tests.</p>
            <strong>Business Associates</strong>
            <p>We may provide your PHI to other companies or individuals that need the information to provide services to
              us. These other entities, known as "business associates," are required to maintain the privacy and security
              of PHI. For example, we may provide information to companies that assist us with billing of our services. We
              may also use an outside collection agency to obtain payment when necessary.</p>
            <strong>As Required by Law.</strong>
            <p>We may use and disclose your PHI as required by law.</p>
            <strong>Law Enforcement Activities and Legal Proceedings</strong>
            <p>We may use and disclose your PHI if necessary, to prevent or lessen a serious threat to your health and safety
              or that of another person. We may also provide PHI to law enforcement officials, for example, in response to
              a warrant, investigative demand or similar legal process, or for officials to identify or locate a suspect,
              fugitive, material witness, or missing person. We may also disclose PHI to appropriate agencies if we reasonably
              believe an individual to be a victim of abuse, neglect or domestic violence.</p>
            <p>We may disclose your PHI as required to comply with a court or administrative order. We may disclose your
              PHI in response to a subpoena, discovery request or other legal process in the course of a judicial or administrative
              proceeding, but only if efforts have been made to tell you about the request or to obtain an order of protection
              for the requested information.</p>
            <strong>Research</strong>
            <p>We may disclose PHI for research purposes when an Institutional Review Board or privacy board has reviewed
              the research proposal and established protocols to ensure the privacy of your PHI and determined that the researcher
              does not need to obtain your authorization prior to using your PHI for research purposes. We may also disclose
              information about decedents to researchers under certain circumstances.</p>
            <strong>Other Uses and Disclosures</strong>
            <p>As permitted by HIPAA, we may disclose your PHI to:</p>

              in disaster relief efforts so that others can be notified about your condition, status and location.</p>
            <strong>Note Regarding State Law</strong>
            <p>For all of the above purposes, when state law is more restrictive than federal law, we are required to follow
              the more restrictive state law.</p>
